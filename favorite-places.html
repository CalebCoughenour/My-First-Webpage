  Have <em>you</em> ever been to any of these places?

    <li><strong> King's Dominion</strong> is an amusement park in Virginia. My memories of King's Dominion are filled with laughter and fun. It's my favorite place to visit!</li>
    <li><strong>Homossassas, Fl</strong> has a natural spring that attracts manatee every winter. My family would visit my grandparents near there and we would go watch them for hours. We even got in the water to swim with them once!</li>
    <li><strong>Multnomah Falls</strong> was one of the first places I hiked when I first visited Portland. The natural beauty is stunning. Once you make it to the top, the view is breathtaking. It helped my decision in moving out West!</li>
